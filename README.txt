My project idea is the design and implementation of a washing machine.
I chose this project because I think that the material we have covered in the past two years will allow me to deploy all acquired skills.
Project will involve selecting between couple of different operating programs (duty cycles, length of washing, water temperature selection) using a potentiometer. User will be able to see selected program and time remaining on a LCD display. LCD brightness will automatically set using a photodiode. Project will consist a safety door feature, which prevent from accidental activation. Temperature sensor, to control a relay connected to AC sourced heater. LEDs will inform user about heating water status. 2x water pumps to simulate washing chamber in a separate, sealed container.
 If all the basic features work correctly I intend to install a GSM modem, to inform the user about the end of the washing process.
I will be using the following components:
DC motor driven by a H-bridge,
LCD screen driven by an I2C chip,
Photodiode, to control LCD brightness,
2x dc water pumps,
AC heater and a relay,
2x DC water pumps,
Status LEDs,
Program selection potentiometer,
Pushbutton as a safety feature.
